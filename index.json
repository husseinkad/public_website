It changed my perspective on a lot of things, helped me become more self-aware and resilient, identify problems and solutions, and achieve most, if not all, of my goals. Journaling also aided my relationships, mental health, and productivity.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s been over 500 days since I started journaling, and I\u0026rsquo;ve done it every day since.\nWhy I Started #\rDuring Ramadan 2022, a challenge called \u0026ldquo;The 29 Challenge\u0026rdquo; began, and I participated, trying to build a couple of habits.\nThe challenge ended, and fortunately, I was selected as one of the winners. As a result, I went on a trip to Turkey with amazing people.\nDuring the trip, we gathered in circles every day, and Mujtaba would ask, \u0026ldquo;How are you feeling and what are you grateful for today?\u0026rdquo;\nI found myself struggling to answer. Feelings? Gratitude? I had never been asked that before. What should I say?\nI wrestled with this question until the end of the trip and realized I might not know myself as well as I thought.\nThe inspiration to journal came from that experience. I also wanted to document my journey, so I decided to start journaling every day.\nI arrived in Baghdad on November 1st, 2022, and began from there.\nHow I Journal #\rWhen I first started, I used a small notebook because I was just beginning, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to burn out. For the first couple of weeks, I wrote about my feelings and gratitude. After that, I started keeping a diary, continuing to write about my feelings and gratitude until the end of the year.\nIn 2023, I felt the need for a change, so I switched from pen and paper to journaling with Notion after two months of journaling.\nPen and paper had a certain feel to it, but it also had limitations for me. With Notion, I can include pictures from my day, have unlimited space to write, and write faster. Many things are automated, such as prompts, titles, and dates, but I learned how to use them over time and as I became comfortable with Notion.\nI journal at night, so when it\u0026rsquo;s 10 PM, a page is generated with the date of the day and the prompts and tags I can use, such as mood and media.\nI sometimes use different prompts, but mostly, writing about my day, feelings, and gratitude is enough. You can always create personalized prompts that align with you, and ChatGPT can help you generate them.\nThe Benefits of Journaling #\rIf you\u0026rsquo;re overthinking, struggling to focus, or feeling lazy, journaling can help you reflect on your thoughts and unblock your productivity.\nThree months make up a quarter of a year, so every quarter, I read what I wrote in the previous quarter.\nI set yearly goals with deadlines like Q1 (the first quarter/first three months of the year) or Q4 (the last quarter). Reading the previous quarter helps me understand why I achieved or didn\u0026rsquo;t achieve my goals and learn from my mistakes since I review everything I did.\nSometimes, I use prompts like \u0026ldquo;lessons learned,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;a message to my future self,\u0026rdquo; or meditations (inspirations and peaceful thoughts from meditation). I tag these prompts so I know which days I used special prompts.\nReflecting this way helps you identify your triggers‚Äîwhat makes you happy, sad, or angry‚Äîand what makes you more productive. You can also identify problems or bad habits that need addressing.\nAdditionally, you can identify toxic and healthy relationships, monitor your health and well-being, and track your progress in whatever you\u0026rsquo;re doing.\nYearly reflection offers the same benefits as quarterly reflection, but it\u0026rsquo;s harder to read 365/366 days in one go. You can divide them into multiple reading days as you prefer.\nReflecting on your day while journaling provides similar benefits, but it requires journaling correctly and consistently over time.\nConclusion #\rJournaling might seem challenging at first, but once it becomes a habit, it will be as easy as drinking water. Take small steps, and you\u0026rsquo;ll get there.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ve heard about my experience‚Äîaren\u0026rsquo;t you inspired yet? Just kidding. Whether you decide to try it or not is entirely up to you. I\u0026rsquo;ll create a Notion tour and a tutorial on how I journal and use Notion for productive and creative purposes.\nIf you have any questions, you can reach out to me on any social media platform. I wish you all the best‚Äîyou\u0026rsquo;ve got this! üî•‚úçÔ∏è\n","date":"28 April 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/journaling/","section":"Posts","summary":"Introduction #\rI love journaling.","title":"My Experience with Journaling for 500+ Days and How It Changed My Life","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"28 April 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/notion/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Notion","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"28 April 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"28 April 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/productivity/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Productivity","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"28 April 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/resilience/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Resilience","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"28 April 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/selfcare/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"SelfCare","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"28 April 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"28 April 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/ar/categories/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%A9/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"ÿßŸÑÿ•ŸÜÿ™ÿßÿ¨Ÿäÿ©","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"28 April 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/ar/tags/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B0%D8%A7%D8%AA/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"ÿßŸÑÿπŸÜÿßŸäÿ© ÿ®ÿßŸÑÿ∞ÿßÿ™","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"28 April 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/ar/tags/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%A9/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"ÿßŸÑŸÉÿ™ÿßÿ®ÿ© ÿßŸÑŸäŸàŸÖŸäÿ©","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"28 April 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/ar/tags/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D8%A9/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ±ŸàŸÜÿ©","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"28 April 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/ar/tags/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%88%D8%B9%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%A7%D9%85/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"ÿßŸÑŸàÿπŸä ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿßŸÖ","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"24 April 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/books/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Books","type":"tags"},{"content":"\rIntroduction #\rHey there, let\u0026rsquo;s talk about this. You know that feeling when you\u0026rsquo;re scrolling through your feed, and it\u0026rsquo;s all about hustling, grinding, and being super productive? Well, there are two main ideas in what I saw: \u0026ldquo;Work Hard Even If You Don\u0026rsquo;t Feel Like It\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Feel Good\u0026rdquo; productivity. Let\u0026rsquo;s see what they\u0026rsquo;re about.\nFeel Good Productivity #\rOverview #\rWhen we think about getting more done, we usually think about working harder and forcing ourselves to do things, even if we don\u0026rsquo;t enjoy them. But what if making work more enjoyable actually made us more productive? That\u0026rsquo;s what Ali Abdaal talks about in his book Feel-Good Productivity.\nKey Points #\rMaking Work Fun: Says making work enjoyable can make us more productive. Changing Perspective: Suggests we focus on enjoying tasks rather than just working hard. Boosting Productivity: Believes that by enjoying our work, we can get more done without stressing out. Can\u0026rsquo;t Hurt Me #\rOverview #\rThis one\u0026rsquo;s different. \u0026ldquo;Can\u0026rsquo;t Hurt Me\u0026rdquo; by David Goggins is about pushing ourselves to the limit. Goggins says facing tough challenges makes us stronger and better able to handle anything that comes our way.\nKey Points #\rPushing Limits: Encourages going beyond what\u0026rsquo;s comfortable to grow. Facing Challenges: Says we should deal with difficulties directly instead of avoiding them. Getting Stronger: Believes overcoming tough situations makes us stronger. Comparing the Two Approaches #\rOverview #\rSo, what\u0026rsquo;s the difference? \u0026ldquo;Feel Good Productivity\u0026rdquo; is about staying positive and taking care of ourselves to be more productive. It\u0026rsquo;s about working smarter, not harder. \u0026ldquo;Can\u0026rsquo;t Hurt Me\u0026rdquo; is about pushing ourselves to do hard things and become tougher.\nConsiderations #\rBeing Positive vs. Pushing Limits: Contrasts positivity with pushing boundaries. Taking Care of Yourself vs. Building Toughness: One focuses on self-care, the other on becoming stronger. Personal Choice: It depends on what works best for you. Conclusion #\rWhich one\u0026rsquo;s better? It depends on you. Some people like positivity and self-care, while others prefer pushing themselves. Remember, this is just a small summary. I really recommend reading the books for a deeper understanding. Keep exploring and finding what works for you.
